Writing code is much more fun than writing documentation.. this README will eventually be written.

This is a repo with the goal of turning the existing [AHRQ-Funded Projects search tool](https://healthit.ahrq.gov/ahrq-funded-projects) data into a machine-readable format which can be visualized, explored, and API-enabled in addition to making it available in the machine-readable formats.

Visit the `.ipynb` python notebook to see code and the `data/` folder for, you guessed it, the data.

If you want to browse the data in your browser, you can follow this link: Summary file (one row per funded project) [NOT YET READY]


This repo is being modeled after [my expedition of scraping CDC Cruise Ship Inspection data.](https://github.com/marks/cdc-cruise-ship-inspections)
